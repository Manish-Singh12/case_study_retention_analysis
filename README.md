# Case Study: Retention Analysis
In order to study the behaviour of customers who become inactive, 
the data from datawarehouse was pulled for a duration of 6 months
and within this duration it was observed which customers were
active or inactive in the beginning of the six month window and which customers are
active/inactive after the 6 month time window.
